        Hello there! Thank you for visiting my homepage. Here you will find a
        brief overview of my career, skills and interests.

        My first education as a German Philologist I received in Ukraine in
        2013. After that I moved to Germany and started in 2014 a new bachelor
        degree in business informatics, which i finished in 2017.

        As a working student, I gathered my first experiences at various
        companies, in different positions: online marketing, business
        development, product management, QA and data analytics.

        Towards the end of my studies, I realized that I am interested in
        software development: I am burning for cool designs and UX, I am curious
        what kind of magic is happening under the hood of software solutions and
        I am eager to learn and try out those things. For my bachelor thesis I
        decided to go for a new Alexa-Skill for Amazon Echo. The skill would
        interact with customer by voice and find the specified food locations
        nearby. Thanks to that project, I learned to use Google APIs, some AWS
        Cloud resources and a plenty about voice recognition kits.

        In the next step, I went for my first Frontend Developer position at a
        small Munich company, where I got profound knowledge about HTML, CSS and
        javascript. Additionally, I had the first insights into Angular.

      <br></br>
      <div>
        Looking for a deeper dive into modern technologies, I found a new
        position as a Fullstack Developer. In this position, I had the biggest
        learning curve, particularly in React, Node, MongoDB, Typescript, Redux,
        Docker and Rancher. Currently, I am still working at this position.
      </div>
      <br></br>
      <div>
        I am not only interested in technologies, but also in UI/UX. And due to
        my whole various experience, I could call myself as an all-rounder. My
        strong sites are: precise and delicate communication, open-mindness to
        any changes, hands-n mentality, helpfulness, high sense of
        responsibility. Still, I have also space to grow, especially in
        stress-resistant, self-timing and conflict management.

      <div>
        What I am doing in my free time? Most of all, I like being in nature. I
        go hiking, biking, swimming or doing outdoors-yoga. When being indoors,
        I prefer watching documentaries, cooking and baking, reading books and
        doing some side projects.
